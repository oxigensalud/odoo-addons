Oxigen Invoicing
==================

* In a vendor bill, when Bill date field is changed it sets the same value in
  Accounting Date field. Same happens with Bill Reference and Payment Reference fields.
  When Bill Reference field is changed, Payment Reference is changed to the same value
* Allow any account as outstanding receipt/payment account in journals. This allows
  to configure SEPA payment order and return flow more easily.
* Change draft entries date when their date is before fiscalyear_period_date.
* Make Bill Reference field required in Vendor Bills
* Show Total with origin currency in invoice tree view
* In a contract, when clicking in the invoice/bill smart button, show invoice/bill date
  in the tree view.
